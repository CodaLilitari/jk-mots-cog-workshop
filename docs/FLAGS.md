# COG flags and numeric values: an evidence-backed reference

> Updated in 0.1.6: read the [JK/MotS flag discoveries](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md) for corrected meanings and new original-executable evidence on the listed entries. Other rows retain their existing evidence grades.

COG Workshop 0.1.6 • 2026-10-04

This replaces the working reference for every flag/value family on the historical Massassi page: **26 historical families, 31 total families, 385 catalog entries and all 32 ThingFlags bit positions**. Completeness means coverage of those families and positions. It does **not** mean every meaning has been proven in original JK, original MotS or every enhanced engine. Unknowns and conflicting names remain visible.

The human reference and machine catalog describe the same evidence. The release bundles `corpus/reference/flags.json` and an identical skill `data/flags.json`. Use family IDs for targeted retrieval instead of loading the entire corpus. The old page remains useful historical evidence; it is not the authority for an unverified entry here.

## Evidence and target boundaries

| Evidence | What it establishes | What it does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original JK 1.01 binary | Registered ThingFlags wrappers, bounded queue/serializer trace and explicitly marked per-value findings | Every bit meaning, connected-client convergence or every executable version |
| Original MotS binary | Independently traced ThingFlags contract and explicitly marked per-value findings | That all JK meanings carry over, or that source annotations prove MotS-only support |
| P: pinned enhanced source | Exact files attributed to revision `b1be98bd4f170b5384cb71b15443a274aac6a937` | Original-game parity |
| C: current enhanced source | Exact separately hashed files; selected readers/writers and behavior | Membership in the pinned revision or original retail parity |
| Indy comparison | Separately pinned OpenJones3D reconstruction, with selected world/wrapper comparisons | Original Indy execution or transferable JK/MotS labels |
| Retail COG usage | An active call exists in a particular source body | That a branch runs in a level, a client accepts a change, or a bit never appears elsewhere |

**Declaration only** means an exact source symbol/value was found. It is a search key, not a verified behavioral promise. A semantic-looking symbol can be wrong, cross-game, backend-specific or dependent on other state. **Source consumer** describes a selected reader/writer with its conditions. **Unresolved** does not mean unused or safe to repurpose. Original per-bit semantics remain unverified unless specifically stated; original-binary findings apply only to the marked entries and selected paths, not every row.

P/C anchors below use paths relative to `src/`. The JSON source manifest records complete-file hashes. Current-only files carry no pinned revision. Names annotated Jones remain visible without being promoted to JK/MotS support. No game, renderer or connected-client test was run for this release. DroidWorks was not analyzed in this flags pass.

## SetThingFlags: what original JK and MotS actually accept

Both inspected originals store the thing flags as a 32-bit word at thing offset0. `SetThingFlags(thing, mask)` ORs a nonzero mask into it; `ClearThingFlags(thing, mask)` ANDs with the complement. They preserve unrelated bits and push no COG result. Neither wrapper has a list of permitted bits or dispatches a separate gameplay operation for each bit. Template `thingflags=` replaces the whole field in the inspected source.

`GetThingFlags` returns the whole word, or integer `0xFFFFFFFF` (signed -1) when thing resolution returns null. Do not treat an invalid result as “every flag is enabled.” Validate the thing before interpreting the word. Accepting arbitrary masks does not establish that arbitrary bits are meaningful, harmless, synchronized or checksum-compatible.

| Original executable identity | Getter | Setter | Clearer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JK 1.01 SHA-256 `4509cd690634ba20e132bd16e713f91e144b17e2beaaad5e678f1ddb189b51d9` | `0x503D00` | `0x503D30` | `0x503D90` |
| MotS SHA-256 `23cd064217f904d36d896f52d3cdd17635bb85441a12e0415c0637504191d974` | `0x554A50` | `0x554A80` | `0x554AE0` |

These are virtual addresses in images based at 0x400000. Recorded decoding was checked against fresh original instruction bytes and executable hashes; no new disassembler run or execution is claimed.

After mutation, the original wrappers conditionally request update type2. The inspected gates require a nonzero global, no COG-field 0x200, and executing message other than startup3/shutdown22. The queue merges repeated thing pointers and allows 16 distinct entries. A full queue can reject a new entry after its local flags have already changed. The immediate type2 serializer copies the **whole current word at drain time** into payload offset 0x1C, subject to further object/predicate gates. MotS has an additional separate-field guard. Transport, receive handling, scheduling and remote convergence remain untraced. A request is not a broadcast guarantee.

### Retail source examples and limits

The bounded scan of 26 indexed retail COG bodies containing the spelling, with comments removed and active calls read, found these literal masks:

| Target | Active literal masks | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JK | `0x4`, `0x8`, `0x10`, `0x80000` | `pow_supershield.cog`, `19_payload.cog`, `06_hidefish.cog`, `02_crowend.cog` |
| MotS | `0x4`, `0x10`, `0x14`, `0x80000` | `pow_supershield.cog`, `weap_carbgun_m.cog`, `kyle_m.cog`, `force_pull.cog` |

`0x14` combines 0x10 and 0x4. The MotS Force Protection occurrence of `SetThingFlags(...,4)` is commented out and was excluded. This establishes source use of some bits, not that every undocumented bit has a stock setter example. Template words, engine writers, clear calls and computed masks are other paths; this bounded scan cannot prove nonuse across all custom COGs. Raw retail scripts are not distributed.

### Authoring rules

- Identify the owning field before choosing a number. Actor, weapon, physics, JK, inventory, surface, face and animation flags are separate domains.
- Use OR for adding bits, AND-complement for clearing, and bitwise tests. Do not use addition to accumulate a bit twice. Scalar geometry/light/collision/type values are assignments, not independent switches.
- Prefer lifecycle operations for timer, pulse, water, attachment, death and respawn state. Direct bit mutation does not initialize associated fields, deliver the same notifications or undo a completed transition.
- Use nested validity checks before getter/mutation calls; the studied COG VM does not promise C-style short-circuit evaluation. Do not use mutators as value-returning expressions.
- `0x80000000` is bit31; its signed32-bit representation is-2147483648. Do not classify flags with `flags > 0`. Verify literal parsing/conversion and native argument width for the actual target instead of passing large masks through flex arithmetic and assuming exactness.
- Verify exact native spelling/availability, then arguments, resources and target behavior. The same enum name in another game is not a porting rule.

## Thing flags

**Domain:** thing.flags. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Every 32-bit position is catalogued. Semantic evidence is bounded and target-specific.

| Bit | Exact source label | Inspected behavior / evidence | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000001` | `SITH_TF_EMITLIGHT` | ThingLight nonzero immediate branch enables the bit; template light= also enables it. Current renderer uses it with positive light and excludes disabled/hidden/destroyed things in the inspected light-collection path. P: Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:449–468; World/sithThing.c:1786–1793. C: Engine/sithRender.c:706–729. | A bit alone supplies neither positive intensity nor a model. Zero immediate ThingLight updates intensity but does not clear the bit. |
| `0x00000002` | `SITH_TF_DESTROYED` | Marks pending removal: ordinary update takes the RemoveThing branch when set; DestroyThing sets it and conditionally sends removed. P: World/sithThing.c:221–302,448–455. | Setting the bit directly bypasses DestroyThing’s immediate removed-notification step. Clearing it is not resurrection or recreation. |
| `0x00000004` | `SITH_TF_4` | Participates in a projectile deflection/ricochet branch when the colliding weapon has SITH_WF_IMPACTSOUND; successful collision handling reflects velocity, changes orientation and plays deflected sound. C: World/sithWeapon.c:667–691. | Not a demonstrated universal invulnerability switch. Conditions include weapon flags, bounce limits and collision handler success; other damage routes are separate. |
| `0x00000008` | `SITH_TF_LEVELGEO` | Separates model things into the level-geometry rendering pass; the ordinary thing pass excludes them. C: Engine/sithRender.c:2486–2513,2770–2772. | Does not by itself make physics immobile, create collision geometry or ensure a model exists. |
| `0x00000010` | `SITH_TF_10` | Filters a thing out of inspected geometry/ordinary rendering and light-collection paths. C: Engine/sithRender.c:706–707,2490–2492,2770–2772. | Describe as render-hidden in these paths, not global disabled: no claim that scripts, physics, collision or sound stop. |
| `0x00000020` | `SITH_TF_20` | No symbolic consumer found in the bounded reviewed runtime files; remains a numeric enum entry. P: types_enums.h:1329; bounded search scope below. | This is not proof that the bit is unused, safe as user storage, absent in retail, or never set in historical COGs. |
| `0x00000040` | `SITH_TF_STANDABLE` | A RAYCAST_10 collision search only accepts candidate things carrying this bit. Pinned floor-finding chooses that mode for non-wall-stick downward search. P: Engine/sithPhysics.c:66–78. C: Engine/sithCollision.c:243–250. | Still requires ordinary collision eligibility; does not create collision geometry, an actor attachment or a valid floor automatically. |
| `0x00000080` | `SITH_TF_80` | When searchFlags includes RAYCAST_8, only thing candidates with this bit pass that filter. Current CheckPathClear issues 0x12A, which includes8. C: Engine/sithCollision.c:243–250,1367–1386. | Use this exact query-filter meaning; do not call it universal collidable, LOS-blocking or ignored-by-all-physics. Other query modes and candidate checks differ. |
| `0x00000100` | `SITH_TF_INVULN` | Suppresses selected COG notifications such as damaged/removed/sector exited. Pinned multiplayer setup marks non-server non-actor things with it. Current actor damage branch bypasses health subtraction when multiplayer and this flag is set. P: World/sithThing.c:448–491,732–733; Dss/sithMulti.c:185–200. C: World/sithActor.c:90–114,152–169. | Not the separate actor SITH_AF_INVULNERABLE bit. The inspected single-player actor path does not make this thing flag a universal damage shield; suppressing damaged notification can also bypass a script’s damage adjustment. |
| `0x00000200` | `SITH_TF_DEAD` | DamageThing rejects dead things. Current DestroyActor sets DEAD while converting the thing to corpse and changing physics/lifetime; current KillActor returns early when already dead. P: World/sithThing.c:470–477. C: World/sithActor.c:213–222,478–486. | DEAD is distinct from DESTROYED. Setting it alone does not perform the complete killed/corpse sequence or schedule removal. |
| `0x00000400` | `SITH_TF_CAPTURED` | CaptureThing sets capture pointer plus bit; template class COG binding and linked COG references also set it. Several engine notifications test it. P: Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:638–658; Cog/sithCog.c:1918–1932; World/sithThing.c:1857–1877. | Setting the bit alone installs no COG pointer or link. ReleaseThing clears the bit only if no class COG or surviving thing link requires it. |
| `0x00000800` | `SITH_TF_NOIMPACTDAMAGE` | Suppresses two explicit crush/impact-damage calls generated when a moving/pushing thing cannot move its attached passenger or collided target far enough. The tested flag is on the mover/pusher. C: Engine/sithCollision.c:682–705,985–1005. | Do not document as blanket fall/impact immunity on the victim. Ordinary collision movement/blocking remains, and unrelated damage paths are not covered. |
| `0x00001000` | `SITH_TF_NOEASY` | Loading computes 0x1000 << jkPlayer_setDiff and frees an explicit level thing when its flags intersect that exclusion mask; this is bit 0x1000 for difficulty index 0. P: World/sithThing.c:1547–1552,1599–1602; types_enums.h:1336. | Identified consumer is a load-time exclusion; runtime SetThingFlags does not rerun the loader. Easy label comes from enum. |
| `0x00002000` | `SITH_TF_NOMEDIUM` | Same load-time mask, bit 0x2000 for difficulty index 1. P: World/sithThing.c:1547–1552,1599–1602; types_enums.h:1337. | Do not present as a continuously enforced runtime hide/disable switch. |
| `0x00004000` | `SITH_TF_NOHARD` | Same load-time mask, bit 0x4000 for difficulty index 2. P: World/sithThing.c:1547–1552,1599–1602; types_enums.h:1338. | Do not present as a continuously enforced runtime hide/disable switch. |
| `0x00008000` | `SITH_TF_8000` | The loader includes 0x8000 in its exclusion mask when g_submodeFlags bit 1 is set. Multiplayer startup sets that submode bit, supporting a multiplayer-exclusion label for this path. P: World/sithThing.c:1547–1552,1599–1602; Dss/sithMulti.c:204–218. | Template/placement/load-time behavior, not a general runtime multiplayer-locality flag. Do not confuse with COG execution or transport flags. |
| `0x00010000` | `SITH_TF_10000` | **Level-placement exclusion in the non-multiplayer loading branch.** The loader adds this bit to its rejection mask when submode bit 1 is clear. A populated level thing whose flags intersect that mask is freed. The corresponding multiplayer branch adds 0x8000 instead. Source multiplayer startup sets the submode bit, supporting the shorthand single-player placement exclusion. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). | This is a loading condition. Setting it after loading does not by itself hide or destroy the thing. The precise original predicate is submode bit 1 clear; other rejection bits, including difficulty, still apply. |
| `0x00020000` | `SITH_TF_PULSESET` | **Engine-maintained thing pulse state.** P Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:598–617: SetThingPulse sets bit plus interval/next time, or clears all three for exactly zero. P Cog/sithCog.c:1544–1550: due pulse advances next time and sends the thing PULSE message.  | P World/sithThing.c:236–240 skips this processing while DISABLED. OR-ing the bit alone does not initialize the interval/deadline. This is the thing timer facility, not the COG instance's SetPulse state. |
| `0x00040000` | `SITH_TF_TIMERSET` | **Engine-maintained one-shot thing timer state.** P Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:619–636: SetThingTimer writes deadline/bit, or clears both for exactly zero. P Cog/sithCog.c:1551–1554 clears the bit before sending TIMER when due.  | Disabled things skip the update. Setting the flag alone does not establish a meaningful deadline. Both thing timer wrappers are registered outside the nearby MotS branch at P Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:2714–2723; this is source registration evidence, not retail proof. |
| `0x00080000` | `SITH_TF_DISABLED` | **Broad disable state/configuration, not just invisibility.** P World/sithThing.c:224–240 still handles lifetime before skipping subsequent timer/control/type updates; :470–477 rejects incoming damage and :732–733/:809–812 suppress sector notifications. C Engine/sithRender.c:2770–2772 excludes disabled ordinary things; C Engine/sithCollision.c:246–250 excludes them from the shown collision-candidate path.  | Lifetime/respawn work is not universally frozen. Dedicated C writers: World/sithItem.c:60–87 sets while awaiting respawn, :116–129 clears on respawn; Gameplay/sithPlayer.c:29–45 sets during slot startup, :471–483 clears when showing player. C Dss/sithDSSThing.c:244–259 has a MotS-specific disabled-to-enabled item/MP/client/respawn-factor/respawn-flag path sending RESPAWN before replacing flags. Not a guarantee that every engine subsystem ignores the thing. |
| `0x00100000` | `SITH_TF_INCAMFOV` | **Renderer-written sighting latch.** C Engine/sithRender.c:3013–3024 checks bit clear and noclip off, sends SIGHTED if CAPTURED, clears AI sleeping mode for an AI with actor data, then sets the bit.  | Happens before the later draw call. A preset bit suppresses this block; it does not force visibility. No dedicated clearing consumer was found in the named-bit searches; generic full-field changes can still clear it. P IsThingVisible at Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:1448–1455 instead compares renderFrame+1 against current tick; do not equate these contracts. |
| `0x00200000` | `SITH_TF_RENDERWEAPON` | **Extra-render callback opt-in, with engine initialization writers.** C Engine/sithRender.c:3048–3052 draws base renderData, then calls the registered extra renderer if this bit is set. C Main/jkMain.c:1677–1678 registers jkPlayer_renderSaberWeaponMesh. P World/jkPlayer.c:350–440 sets it for initialized players/boss actors; :2091–2112 sets it in the JKM_DSS info-allocation helper.  | P callback :989–1008 needs playerInfo and puppet data; :1034–1083 branches on persuasion/Seeing, geometry, weapon model and saber flags. Bit alone neither creates weapon resources nor guarantees a visible weapon. It is not a POV-only flag. The similarly named test in current Main/jkControl.c:63 reads actorParams.flags, a different domain, and was not used as Thing.flags evidence. |
| `0x00400000` | `SITH_TF_METAL` | **Material/sound configuration on the supporting or struck thing.** P Engine/sithPuppet.c:647–697 selects metal footstep modes from attachedThing; P World/sithThing.c:1320–1344 selects LANDMETAL. C Gameplay/sithPlayerActions.c:141–154 selects JUMPMETAL; C Engine/sithCollision.c:1032–1044 selects HITMETAL after qualifying collision.  | Sound classes, attachment/marker and movement/collision conditions still apply. Metal wins before Earth in the inspected paired tests. No claim of generic damage resistance, mass, or collision strength. |
| `0x00800000` | `SITH_TF_EARTH` | **Material/sound configuration.** Same pinned footstep/landing paths select earth modes after metal is absent; C Gameplay/sithPlayerActions.c:144–151 selects JUMPEARTH after metal.  | This does not change geometry, friction or physics in those paths. The inspected hit-sound branch has metal-versus-hard, not an Earth branch. |
| `0x01000000` | `SITH_TF_1000000` | **Unresolved.** P enum:1348; no named consumer found.  | Do not import Indy NOSOUND as a proven JK/MotS meaning. Literal/composite paths are not exhausted. |
| `0x02000000` | `SITH_TF_WATER` | **Engine-maintained water/submersion state.** P World/sithThing.c:796–807 compares underwater sector state with this bit and invokes transitions; EnterWater :822 sets it, ExitWater :882 clears it.  | Manually toggling the bit is not equivalent to running transition code: puppet mode, sounds, removal tests and slowdown are separate operations. C World/sithActor.c:226–248 uses it for underwater-death sound after other checks. C AI/sithAI.c:1067–1075 distinguishes observer/target water states, with a surface-physics exception; :823–844 uses it in a conditional movement path. C AI/sithAICmd.c:264–275 uses it for chosen destination height. |
| `0x04000000` | `SITH_TF_IGNOREGOURAUDDISTANCE` | **Rendering configuration bypass for one downgrade.** C Engine/sithRender.c:2946–2969: with ambient below 1, distance at/above gouradDistance and bit clear cap lighting to DIFFUSE; bit set routes to a cap at GOURAUD instead.  | It does not force Gouraud if desired mode is lower, nor override the earlier ambient>=1 branches. yval includes camera zoom adjustment at :2838–2843. No Main_bMotsCompat guard surrounds this consumer in the current function. |
| `0x08000000` | `SITH_TF_DROWNS` | **Destroy-on-water-entry configuration.** P World/sithThing.c:822–830 first sets WATER, then sets DESTROYED if DROWNS, optionally sending REMOVED if CAPTURED and the 0x100 gate is clear.  | Immediate destruction state in this path, not the player's timed breathing/drowning system. It bypasses the ordinary non-drowning splash/slowdown branch. No MotS-only guard around this bit test. |
| `0x10000000` | `SITH_TF_WATERCREATURE` | **Destroy-on-water-exit configuration.** P World/sithThing.c:880–905 clears WATER/changes puppet mode, processes exit sound, then sets DESTROYED and conditionally sends REMOVED.  | Not a general swim/AI-capability flag. Its destruction branch is not prevented by bNoSplash; no MotS-only guard surrounds the bit test. |
| `0x20000000` | `SITH_TF_SPLASHES` | **Splash-message opt-in.** P World/sithThing.c:831–856 entry: non-drowning/no-splash-suppression path, local player exists, this bit set, 0x100 clear; sends SPLASH to the local player's class/capture COG with entering thing as sender and source reference 1. Exit :899–920 excludes WATERCREATURE and applies suppression/local-player/0x100 conditions, using source reference 0.  | This is a message request, not direct creation of a splash effect. Ordinary water sound code is separate and not gated by SPLASHES. The recipient is the local player's COGs, even when another thing entered. No MotS-only guard surrounds these message tests. |
| `0x40000000` | `SITH_TF_40000000` | **Unresolved in bounded JK/MotS source audit.** P enum:1354; no named consumer found.  | Do not import Indy MOVABLE. No unused-bit guarantee; raw/composite masks and original implementations remain possible gaps. |
| `0x80000000` | `SITH_TF_80000000` | **One deferred eligible thing in the MotS renderer.** Original MotS stores an eligible flagged thing in one local pointer slot and skips its ordinary draw. Later eligible flagged things overwrite that slot. After normal traversal, the final stored thing is drawn once. The corresponding complete JK1.01 routine lacks this test and slot. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). | This is not a queue for all flagged things, and it does not establish through-wall rendering. Earlier eligibility/clipping applies. The inspected JK difference is function-specific, not proof of game-wide bit nonuse. No visual runtime result is claimed. |

## Actor flags

**Domain:** actor/player type parameters. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Aliases conflict; Jones annotations are not stock-game support. Get/Set/ClearActorFlags alias type wrappers, which dispatch by actual thing type.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |

<a id="attach"></a>

## Attachment flags

**Domain:** thing attachment state. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Zero means no bits set. A raw flag write does not construct surface/thing pointers or linked lists. Use the dedicated attachment operation; 0x10 has a MotS annotation.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000001` (1) | `SITH_ATTACH_SURFACE` | **Surface attachment discriminator.** The native surface attachment setter records its target and writes discriminator 1 into attach_flags. Surface attachment stores a surface; Thing-face stores a parent and face; ordinary Thing attachment maintains parent/child links and a relative position. Detach selects its surface or shared Thing/face branch from this separate field. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Attachment flags are not Thing.flags: their offsets are JK +0x34 and MotS +0x3C. AttachThingToThingEx ORs its extra mask into this field after ordinary attachment.

Detach selects its surface or shared Thing/face branch from this separate field. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Attachment flags are not Thing.flags: their offsets are JK +0x34 and MotS +0x3C. AttachThingToThingEx ORs its extra mask into this field after ordinary attachment.

| `0x00000004` (4) | `SITH_ATTACH_THING` | **Ordinary thing attachment discriminator.** The native ordinary Thing attachment setter records its target and writes discriminator 4 into attach_flags. Surface attachment stores a surface; Thing-face stores a parent and face; ordinary Thing attachment maintains parent/child links and a relative position. Detach selects its surface or shared Thing/face branch from this separate field. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Attachment flags are not Thing.flags: their offsets are JK +0x34 and MotS +0x3C. AttachThingToThingEx ORs its extra mask into this field after ordinary attachment.

## Damage types

**Domain:** damage operation / projectile damageclass. **Kind:** `integer-with-mixed-consumers`.

Some consumers compare exact values or switch on the whole integer. Combining bits does not guarantee additive behavior. FIRE is the source name for 0x4; FALL0x40 is separate.

## Explosion flags

**Domain:** explosion type parameters. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Separate from thing.flags and damageclass. Resources, radius, times and child templates remain necessary. Some debris annotations are uncertain Jones ancestry.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Domain:** goal+100 inventory bin amount. **Kind:** `bitmask-in-inventory-amount`.

SetGoalFlags/ClearGoalFlags modify an integer cast of inventory amount, then use the normal clamping/changed path. The secret bit is commented unused in the declaration.

## World item flags

**Domain:** world pickup type parameters. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Respawn needs stored position/sector and timing. BACKPACK does not initialize contents. The header carries an uncertain Jones annotation; reviewed consumers support narrower conclusions.

## JK player/saber flags

**Domain:** thing.jkFlags. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

JKSetFlags ORs and JKClearFlags clears. JKGetFlags returns0 on invalid thing in the inspected source, unlike GetThingFlags. Model/puppet and saber state remain required.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `0x00000020` (32) | `JKFLAG_PERSUASION` | Reviewed extra-render callback branches on saber-on/dual-sabers or persuasion/Seeing. It needs valid player/puppet/model state; the bit alone is not the complete feature. P: World/jkPlayer.c:989-1083 |
| `0x00000040` (64) | `JKFLAG_40` | **Consume-once saber hit-history reset.** When the eligible saber collision path sees this bit, it clears the bit and resets the counts of already-hit things and surfaces. The stored histories are pointer lists. The separate saber-damage-enable bit is tested afterward. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This requests a reset when the path next consumes it; it does not itself enable damage or guarantee another hit. Source puppet marker 0xE sets it, but the original marker dispatch table was not independently reconstructed in this pass. |
| `0x00000080` (128) | `JKFLAG_SABERFORCEON` | **Force maximum saber length on the eligible update branch.** When neither the extend-4 nor retract-8 branch is selected, bit 0x80 sets saber length to its configured maximum, writes about 0.6 to the source-named timeLeftLengthChange field, clears 4/8 and sets 1. Both original branches retain 0x80; current enhanced source clears it. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). The inspected callers already require JK flag 1 and the routine needs valid player information. Setting 0x80 alone does not enter that caller path. Extend/retract branches take priority. This is not a universal unretractable-saber or runtime appearance claim. |
| `0x00000100` (256) | `JKFLAG_100` | **MotS bubble-owner registration marker.** jkCreateBubble registers owner/radius-squared/type in the bubble array and sets this bit on the owner. jkDestroyBubble clears both the record and bit. A query removes a registered record if its owner no longer has the bit. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This marks the bubble owner, not a thing merely located inside a bubble. Setting the bit alone does not allocate a bubble record or specify radius/type. Use the bubble verbs. An original-JK meaning is not established; lack of bubble verbs is not proof that the bit is universally unused. |

## Multiplayer mode flags

**Domain:** multiplayer game mode. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Named bits do not establish every server/client effect. COOP is an enhanced-fork addition in the inspected spawn logic, not claimed original retail.

| `0x00000002` (2) | `MULTIMODEFLAG_2` | **Conditional same-team player health-damage suppression.** The original actor/player damage paths test multiplayer mode bit 0x2 and return zero before health subtraction when a same-team helper succeeds. That helper also requires teams bit 0x1, distinct player things, non-null player records, and equal nonzero team numbers. The source parent is compared with the victim. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Self-damage, team zero and unequal teams do not meet this predicate. Earlier COG/inventory callbacks may already have run. This does not promise suppression of all messages, every other damage path or network convergence. |

EMIT_LIGHT selects a particle lighting mode in the inspected constructor, not demonstrated dynamic-world illumination. RANDOM_CEL_CHANGE0x20 is not a verified geometric flip.

## Physics flags

**Domain:** physics movement parameters. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Requires physics movement. Set ORs; Clear clears and lacks Set’s explicit sync request in the inspected wrapper. Template physflags= replaces the field. Undeclared top four bits remain unresolved.

| `0x00008000` (32768) | `SITH_PF_8000` | **Pending bypass of the inspected attached-physics drag application.** The original ApplyForce implementation sets 0x8000 while adding force divided by positive mass to a physics mover velocity, even when the supplied force vector is zero. In the inspected surface/Thing-face attached-physics block, nonzero velocity and nonzero surface drag lead to a bit test: if set, the block clears 0x8000 and skips its linear drag call. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This is a conditional consumed marker, not permanent friction immunity. If those block prerequisites are not reached it is not consumed there, so a one-frame lifetime is unproved. Setting the bit alone does not apply an impulse. Other drag paths and runtime motion remain untested. |

A set 0x20000 skips that transform in both originals. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This is not a general angular-velocity, continuous-spin or object-orientation disable flag. MotS can apply the COG-supplied look vector after native creation; the transform uses the orientation at native creation time, not necessarily the final look-vector orientation. Setting the flag later does not undo the transform. |

<a id="sound"></a>

## Sound flags

**Domain:** sound playback/channel state. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Separate resource IDs from playback handles. This inventory contains engine-managed states as well as call options; do not pass every named bit as an authoring option.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000001` (1) | `SITHSOUNDFLAG_LOOP` | **Looping attached sound cleanup when its owner is freed.** In the inspected owner-free cleanup, a matching sound with FOLLOWSTHING 0x80 and LOOP 0x1 takes the channel cleanup branch, conditionally stopping active playback and freeing its channel. The matching nonloop branch instead detaches the sound to the last position. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This adds an original lifecycle consumer of LOOP, not a complete looping/playback contract or an audibility test. The channel must pass owner and follow-state tests. Sound flags are separate from Thing.flags. |
| `0x00000002` (2) | `SITHSOUNDFLAG_FADING` | StopSound with positive fade duration marks fading; this is maintained playback state. P: Cog/sithCogFunctionSound.c:22-199,250-272; C: Devices/sithSoundMixer.c:217-248 |

| `0x00000040` (64) | `SITHSOUNDFLAG_ABSOLUTE` | **Absolute stored position after a nonlooping sound loses its owner.** The matching nonlooping FOLLOWSTHING sound has bit 0x80 cleared and bit 0x40 set during owner-free cleanup, and receives the owner final position. The inspected position update selects the stored position when 0x40 is set. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This verifies the transition and position selection, not successful playback or audibility. Existing source-based PlaySoundPos behavior is retained in the prior interpretation. It establishes no Thing.flags 0x01000000 meaning. |
| `0x00000080` (128) | `SITHSOUNDFLAG_FOLLOWSTHING` | **Followed-owner sound lookup and detachment at owner cleanup.** Owner-free cleanup selects channels carrying 0x80 whose owner pointer matches the freed Thing. Looping channels enter channel cleanup; nonlooping channels clear 0x80, set absolute-position 0x40 and copy the owner final position. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This is sound-channel state, not Thing.flags. Other creation and playback gates, networking and runtime audio remain outside this original-static finding. |

## Surface flags

**Domain:** world surface.flags. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Not face typeFlags, adjoin flags or animation state. Source label AI_CAN_WALK_ON_FLOOR has a polarity problem: reviewed AI consumers reject 0x8.

<a id="light"></a>

## Light mode values

**Domain:** render lighting mode. **Kind:** `scalar`.

Values4/5 remain unresolved. Mode6 has a bounded original-MotS inherited-lighting path, absent in the compared JK routines. Renderer caps and later processing still affect the result.

Mode 6 bypasses the ordinary mesh lighting cap and copies that scalar into every face extraLight field at face+0x30. One original producer stores the mean of computed scalar vertex-light outputs in mesh+0x44. The compared JK1.01 hierarchy/mesh routines lack this inheritance, cap exception and mode-6 copy. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Scalar mode, not a flag bit. Requires a valid ancestor chain and mesh; the original walk lacks the modern null checks. Stored values can be stale, and culling, draw order, face-mode caps and later rendering still matter. It is not proof of fullbright, per-vertex RGB or a dynamic-only value. Current source instead transfers radius at this hierarchy step; original MotS parses and uses radius at mesh+0x48, distinct from the transferred +0x44. No runtime proof. |

<a id="face"></a>

## Face type / surface type flags

**Domain:** face.typeFlags. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

Historical surface type is a bitmask:0 has no options,1 and2 can coexist. Distinct from surface.flags. Jones annotations and unverified filtering/Z behavior are not retail support.

The complete compared JK1.01 model-face routine lacks this override. This proves a lighting consumer beyond the nearest-filter enum label. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This is an initial mode override in the model-face path.

| `0x00004000` (16384) | `SITH_WF_DAMAGE_DECAY` | **Distance-based damage reduction in the 0x10000 handler.** At a terminal collision in the original 0x10000 handler, this bit subtracts rate times hit distance from the local damage amount and floors it at minDamage in both games. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). This updates a local hit amount, not the persistent weapon damage field. Preserve the separately documented ordinary-update decay difference between current source and original JK. Finite-value control flow is established; downstream damage acceptance and runtime outcomes are not. |
| `0x00008000` (32768) | `SITH_WF_OBJECT_TRAIL` | **Conditional segmented object-trail creation in the 0x10000 handler.** The original handler attempts trail-template creation along a locally advanced orientation when bit 0x8000, a trail template and the step/projection versus hit-distance or range gates permit it. The no-hit tail can also create a trail up to range. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). Creation return values are ignored, so allocation and visuals are not proved. The loops have no explicit iteration cap or general progress guard: termination depends on advancing configured step/orientation. This is not a reproduced hang, networking proof or a universal trail contract. |
| `0x00010000` (65536) | `SITH_WF_10000` | **Select the range-based collision-query and optional trail handler.** In both original dispatchers, weapon 0x10000 selects this handler after the higher-priority 0x2000 branch. The complete handler traverses returned adjoin crossings and handles the first returned non-adjoin result. Thing hits call damage and can independently attempt force; world hits call surface impact. A non-null impact template enables a creation attempt. The final callee marks the weapon Thing.flags 0x2 for destruction. Original executable paths. [Evidence and target limits](FLAG_DISCOVERIES.md). The query uses moveSize as well as range, so this is not established as a zero-width ray. One terminal result is handled; collision ordering and penetration are not established. Destruction is marked, not an immediate storage free. Full downstream helper behavior, successful allocation, visuals and networking remain untested. |

Additional domain.0 affine,1 perspective are source labels;2/3/4 remain unknown. A desired mode is not a verified final rendering result.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000000` (0) | `RD_TEXTUREMODE_AFFINE` | Declaration only; per-bit behavior not established in this audit. P: src/types_enums.h:34 |
| `0x00000001` (1) | `RD_TEXTUREMODE_PERSPECTIVE` | Declaration only; per-bit behavior not established in this audit. P: src/types_enums.h:35 |
| `0x00000002` (2) | `RD_TEXTUREMODE_2_UNK` | Unresolved numeric/source name; no safe-spare-bit inference. P: src/types_enums.h:36 |
| `0x00000003` (3) | `RD_TEXTUREMODE_3_UNK` | Unresolved numeric/source name; no safe-spare-bit inference. P: src/types_enums.h:37 |
| `0x00000004` (4) | `RD_TEXTUREMODE_4_UNK` | Unresolved numeric/source name; no safe-spare-bit inference. P: src/types_enums.h:38 |

<a id="super"></a>

## Player superflags

**Domain:** local selected player super-weapon/shield/Force state. **Kind:** `bitmask-over-three-booleans`.

No player argument; unknown bits are ignored in the inspected source. Does not itself implement every powerup effect.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000001` (1) | `WEAPON_SUPER` | Weapon-super boolean. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Cog/jkCog.c:388 |
| `0x00000002` (2) | `SHIELD_SUPER` | Shield-super boolean. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Cog/jkCog.c:390 |
| `0x00000004` (4) | `FORCE_BOOST` | Force-boost boolean. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Cog/jkCog.c:392 |

<a id="respawn"></a>

## Multiplayer respawn masks

**Domain:** multiplayer spawn-index selection. **Kind:** `32-bit-index-exclusion-mask`.

SetRespawnMask replaces the word. In the inspected selector, set bits exclude candidate indices; the historical examples are exclusion complements, not individual flags. Current fork/co-op changes prevent a retail claim.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0000FFFF` (65535) | `EXCLUDE_0_THROUGH_15` | Leaves indices16..31 available to this mask; other selection rules still apply. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Dss/sithMulti.c:301 |
| `0xFFFF00FF` (4294902015) | `EXCLUDE_EXCEPT_8_THROUGH_15` | Leaves indices8..15 available to this mask. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Dss/sithMulti.c:301 |
| `0xFFFFFF00` (4294967040) | `EXCLUDE_EXCEPT_0_THROUGH_7` | Leaves indices0..7 available to this mask. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. P: src/Dss/sithMulti.c:301 |

<a id="animation"></a>

## Surface/material animation flags

**Domain:** runtime material/surface animation. **Kind:** `bitmask`.

These low options are animation flags, not world-surface flags despite reused source constants. Use the animation API, not SetSurfaceFlags.

| Value | Exact symbol or descriptive catalog label | Evidence / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00000001` (1) | `LOOP` | Wrap after the final cel instead of finishing. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. C: src/World/sithSurface.c:846 |
| `0x00000002` (2) | `START_AND_LOOP_BASE_1` | Start at cel1 unless 0x4 is set; loop base1 takes precedence over 0x4. This is not skip-last-frame. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. C: src/World/sithSurface.c:849 |
| `0x00000004` (4) | `START_AND_LOOP_BASE_2` | Start at cel2; loop base2 only when 0x2 is absent. Both bits together start2 then loopbase1. Cel count matters. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. C: src/World/sithSurface.c:853 |
| `0x00000008` (8) | `RESET_ON_COMPLETION` | On nonloop completion reset to cel0 instead of holding final cel, then release animation. Source annotation: Descriptive catalog label; not necessarily a native C symbol. C: src/World/sithSurface.c:875 |

Unlisted positions in this selected declaration inventory: `0x00000010`, `0x00000020`, `0x00000040`, `0x00000080`, `0x00000100`, `0x00000200`, `0x00000400`, `0x00000800`, `0x00001000`, `0x00002000`, `0x00004000`, `0x00008000`, `0x00010000`, `0x00020000`, `0x00040000`, `0x00080000`, `0x00100000`, `0x00200000`, `0x00400000`, `0x00800000`, `0x01000000`, `0x02000000`, `0x04000000`, `0x08000000`, `0x10000000`, `0x20000000`, `0x40000000`, `0x80000000`. These remain unresolved, not proved unused.

## Contract details that prevent common mistakes

Get/Set/ClearActorFlags, WeaponFlags, ItemFlags, ExplosionFlags and ParticleFlags alias the type-flags functions in P `Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:2139-2217,2801-2818`. The thing's actual type selects the union field. A misleadingly named call does not coerce that type. Template `typeflags=` is interpreted by the template's type parser.

P `Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:1796-1827` gives SetPhysicsFlags an explicit conditional sync request but not ClearPhysicsFlags. This asymmetry needs a multiplayer test; it is not proof that clearing can never reach a peer by another path.

SetInvFlags changes shared inventory definitions (P `Cog/sithCogFunction.c:783-797`, `Gameplay/sithInventory.c:688-707`). Per-player activated/available/found flags are separate. Goal masks use the integer-cast amount of bin goal+100, then normal amount clamping and changed delivery (P `Cog/sithCogFunctionPlayer.c:78-100`, `Gameplay/sithInventory.c:548-573`). Do not invent callable GetInvFlags/ClearInvFlags from internal C helper names: those exact native spellings are absent from the measured original registries.

Sector/surface flag setters OR and clearers AND-complement, with conditional synchronization (P `Cog/sithCogFunctionSector.c:199-237`, `Cog/sithCogFunctionSurface.c:243-281`). Adjoin verbs take a surface reference, resolve its one adjoin, and do not explicitly mutate the mirror in their wrappers (`283-338`). FaceType is a mask; FaceGeoMode/LightMode/TexMode are scalar assignments. Geometry assignment can be reduced when required material/UV data is absent (`340-466`). Desired thing modes need not equal the final renderer mode.

PlaySoundThing/Pos return playback references, not sound resource IDs. Local playback clears position/follow flags; attached playback sets up the corresponding channel state (P `Cog/sithCogFunctionSound.c:22-199`). StopSound consumes that playback reference. Runtime PLAYING/PAUSED/FADING names are not a promise that all are valid caller options.

SurfaceAnim(surface, rate, flags) and MaterialAnim(material, rate, flags) return animation indices (P `Cog/sithCogFunction.c:153-210`). Creation and loop precedence differ when 0x2 and 0x4 are combined. Keyframe PlayKey options are a different domain: the low options map into puppet-track states through an else-if chain (P `Engine/sithPuppet.c:222-279`). StopKey uses the returned track, not the original keyframe resource.

The pinned source explicitly guards some MotS behaviors, including PlayKey rejecting a dead local player and actor freeze/blind combinations. Other comments say “MoTS added” without guarding the surrounding branch. The absence of a compatibility guard is source structure, not proof that stock JK supports a feature. Current MotS-mode item collision 0x10 is also a separate type-flags case, not a ThingFlags bit.

## Indy comparison: useful evidence, separate meanings

[OpenJones3D](https://github.com/smlu/OpenJones3D) reconstructs Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. This comparison pins revision `a675b395a5d5cff238332d091368483b849e8b5b`; it does not claim an original Indy runtime test. Its ThingFlags wrappers also OR/AND-complement nonzero masks (Libs/sith/Cog/sithCogFunctionThing.c:2935-2988). Matching operations do not make the bit meanings portable.

Jones SNOW0x10000 has material-sound consumers at Libs/sith/World/sithThing.c:1524-1555 and2800-2816. That does not establish a JK/MotS meaning; the independently traced original JK/MotS loader uses 0x10000 for the conditional placement exclusion described above. Jones NOSOUND0x1000000, CLIMBCRATE0x4000000, MOVABLE0x40000000 and WHIPSWING0x80000000 are separate declarations, not replacements for JK/MotS meanings. In particular, the current enhanced renderer and the inspected original MotS routine use 0x80000000 for a single deferred-draw slot; the compared original JK1.01 routine lacks that path.

Even similar water/splash names conceal different contracts. The inspected JK path sends splash messages to the local player's class/capture COG; the Jones entry path sends to the entering thing's own COGs (Jones World/sithThing.c:1981-1990). Jones destroy-on-water/air paths call DestroyThing and return; the inspected JK paths directly set destruction state and conditionally notify. Copy the integration contract only after comparing consumers.

## Corrections and remaining work

The historical AI0x29 entry is a composite value, not an individual bit. The source's 0x20 TOUGHSKIN label is not sufficient to replace it with a verified fire-target description. Duplicate physics 0x10000 descriptions are not accepted as two independent flags. The ghost type8 radius mask is 0x100, not 0x80. Thing DESTROYED0x2 and DEAD0x200 are distinct. Geometry5 and light4/5 remain unknown here. Source aliases for actor 0x2000 and 0x200000 conflict and stay visible.

This release replaces reliance on unqualified tables; it does not erase the historical reference or claim its every entry was wrong. The next evidentiary step for unresolved meanings is target-specific consumer tracing followed by a small original-game reproduction. Record exact executable/hash, caller, owning field, mask, parameters, authority, before/after state and cleanup. For network claims use separate connected clients. Do not use spare-looking bits for custom state based on a negative text search.

The optional Workshop discovery reporter remains off by default. A genuinely new or contradictory result can be prepared as a local draft with provenance and credit; sending still requires the user's explicit instruction. No report is sent by reading this reference.
